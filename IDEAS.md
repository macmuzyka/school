### Ideas to further improve & develop school application

- [x] Simple frontend for application with spring + mvc to view collected student, classes & grades
- [ ] When devel profile is chosen, saving insert time of random grades to database for different count of grades and
  database type (H2 or PostgresSQL) - for measured time compare, statistics & possible differences shown on graphs
- [ ] Student list input to be of different file type not only text file -> .xls
- [ ] Implement logging with visibility scope (teacher, student, legal guardian)
- [ ] Teacher entity with assigned subject -> only teacher of given subject can add grade to this subject
- [ ] Legal guardian entity with assigned student (visible grades of student that is associated with guardian)
- [ ] Weighted grades (some grades are worth more than others, thus counting average grade will be different)
